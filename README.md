# Pokemon-App
A simple pokemon app made with Angular.

## Description
The app contains 4 different views, namely catalogue, login, pokemon-detail and trainer. You can login with your name, which will be stored in local storage. From there you can explore the different pokemons, their moves and their abilities. As you page through the pokemons you can "collect" them, retrieving them to your profile. Once you've collected a few pokemons, you can view them in your profile, where the abilities, moves and so on will be displayed.
